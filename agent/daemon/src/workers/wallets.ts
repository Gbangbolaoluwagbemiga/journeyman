// wallets.ts — provisioning a real wallet for a human who has never heard the word.
//
// The promise of managed mode is that a designer, a copywriter, a voice artist
// can take a paid commission without installing anything or learning what a
// chain is. That promise rests entirely on this file: the moment someone joins,
// Journeyman asks Circle for an MPC wallet in their name and writes one row.
//
// Custody, precisely — because a judge will ask:
//   • The wallet is Circle MPC. The key exists only as split shares and is never
//     assembled, so there is no export and no reveal. Not for them, not for us.
//   • Journeyman NEVER holds their money. When work is approved, the escrow contract
//     pays their wallet directly. Journeyman signs instructions; it is not a
//     custodian of funds.
//   • The exit is a withdrawal to an address they control, not a key export.
//
// The honest framing: their money is fully theirs and fully extractable; the key
// is not extractable by anyone.

/**
 * Gas handed to a brand-new worker so their first application can be signed.
 *
 * GAS IS ETH HERE, AND THAT IS NOT A COSMETIC DIFFERENCE.
 *
 * On the previous chain the native currency WAS USDC, also exposed as an ERC-20
 * at the same value, so one small USDC transfer covered gas and was the same
 * asset they get paid in. A managed worker could not land in the beginner trap
 * of holding tokens with no gas to move them.
 *
 * Arbitrum splits those apart again. This function kept transferring USDC after
 * the port, so a new worker was handed 0.05 USDC and zero ETH — they could hold
 * money and could not sign a single transaction. Worse, ensureGas measured the
 * same USDC balance against its floor, saw 0.05 >= 0.01, and reported them
 * funded; the first thing they would actually see is a raw "insufficient funds
 * for gas" from the chain, which the API's sanitiser renders as OUR treasury
 * being empty.
 *
 * 0.0005 ETH is roughly three hundred applications at the gas price this chain
 * has been running at. It is a floor, not a budget.
