// wallets.ts — provisioning a real wallet for a human who has never heard the word.
//
// The promise of managed mode is that a designer, a copywriter, a voice artist
// can take a paid commission without installing anything or learning what a
// chain is. That promise rests entirely on this file: the moment someone joins,
// Atelier asks Circle for an MPC wallet in their name and writes one row.
//
// Custody, precisely — because a judge will ask:
//   • The wallet is Circle MPC. The key exists only as split shares and is never
//     assembled, so there is no export and no reveal. Not for them, not for us.
//   • Atelier NEVER holds their money. When work is approved, the escrow contract
//     pays their wallet directly. Atelier signs instructions; it is not a
//     custodian of funds.
//   • The exit is a withdrawal to an address they control, not a key export.
//
// The honest framing: their money is fully theirs and fully extractable; the key
// is not extractable by anyone.
