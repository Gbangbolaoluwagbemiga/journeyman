// VisionReviewer — actually look at the deliverable.
//
// The hole this closes: WorkReviewer grades the freelancer's DESCRIPTION of
// their work. Given "delivered as SVG and PNG at 2400px, CMYK, trademark-cleared"
// it would happily write back "the submission meets all critical criteria,
// including delivery in SVG and PNG formats" — asserting as fact something it
// had only been told. Our pitch says "a logo with taste". You cannot judge taste,
// or resolution, or whether the thing is even a logo, from a sentence about it.
//
// So: when a submission carries an image and a vision-capable model is available,
// look at it and report what is actually there.
//
// When one ISN'T available, this returns `available: false` and the reviewer
// says plainly that it assessed a description rather than an artifact. That
// matters more than it sounds — silently grading a claim while sounding like
// you inspected a file is the single most misleading thing this system could do.
