// AgentClient — the agent. Runs the full hire loop headlessly on the
// server: brief → escrow → applications → hire → review → pay. No browser
// involved; the React app only ever watches this over SSE.
//
// Two bugs fixed from the v1 (browser) prototype:
//   1. Escalation counter — `shouldEscalateToHuman` now receives the FULL review
//      history for a milestone (persisted in SQLite via store.appendReview) and
//      a FIXED max (brief.revisionRounds), instead of a single-element array and
//      a number that shrank every call (which meant it could never escalate).
//      History is persisted rather than held in memory because a daemon restart
//      mid-dispute would otherwise reset the rejection count to zero.
//   2. Application scoring is one comparative call across all applicants
//      (ApplicationScorer.pickBestApplicant), not N isolated calls with no
//      cross-applicant context and a bigger prompt-injection surface.
