// ApplicantEvidence — what we can CHECK about an applicant, as opposed to what
// they told us.
//
// The scorer used to receive an address, a proposed timeline, and a cover letter
// written by the applicant. Everything of substance in that is self-asserted:
// "experienced brand designer, 40+ logos delivered" is a sentence, not a fact,
// and the model had no way to tell the difference between someone who has done
// the work and someone who writes well about doing the work. Asked how we verify
// an applicant is qualified, the honest answer was that we largely didn't.
//
// Meanwhile Atelier already holds real evidence and wasn't using it for the
// decision: every job is on a public chain, ratings are written to the contract
// on completion, and disputes are a matter of record. This module gathers that
// and hands it to the scorer as VERIFIED FACT, kept clearly apart from the
// untrusted letter.
//
// It also READS what they linked. "The link resolves" is nearly worthless for
// judging somebody: a developer with a real GitHub or a proper CV has put their
// evidence one fetch away. Most CVs and portfolios are HTML, so we fetch, strip
// the markup, and let the scorer read what they have actually built.
//
// The on-chain record is deliberately a MINOR input. Weighting it heavily would
// entrench whoever arrived first and permanently disadvantage the newcomer with
// a stronger CV — and since Atelier creates a wallet for every managed worker,
// every genuine new applicant starts with an empty record BY CONSTRUCTION.
// Judging people on a record we just made for them would be circular.
