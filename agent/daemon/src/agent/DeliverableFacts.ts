// DeliverableFacts — what we can establish about a delivered file WITHOUT a
// vision model.
//
// The reviewer's honest fallback ("I judged a description, not the work") is
// correct but weak, and it is the state we are actually in: the Anthropic
// account has no credit, and Groq serves no vision model. Left there, a
// freelancer who uploads any real file and describes it confidently is judged
// on the description alone.
//
// But "we cannot rasterise it" was doing far more damage than it needed to,
// because a lot of a deliverable is checkable with no model at all:
//
//   - An SVG *is* text. It is also the single most likely logo deliverable.
//     Reading the XML tells you whether it is a real drawing or an empty file
//     with one rectangle, and embedded <title>/<text> often names what it is.
//   - PNG/JPEG/GIF dimensions live in the file header, six bytes in. "Legible
//     at small sizes" and "2400px" stop being claims.
//   - Audio can be transcribed by Whisper, which Groq does serve free. A
//     voiceover script criterion becomes literally checkable.
//
// None of this judges taste. It does mean a freelancer cannot be paid for an
// empty file, a 40x40 thumbnail sold as print-ready, or a voiceover that says
// something other than the script.
